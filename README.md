Saphir is a robust sheep-dip solution.

## Goals

Computer threats are omnipresent and constitute at best an obstacle to a company or an administration by depriving it of resources (human and financial) that could be allocated to its development and at worst a critical risk of blocking its activities.

The sheep-dip is not a solution in itself to this problem, but one of the essential links in the security chain of an organization.

The sheep-dip intervenes in the reduction of risks related to viral infections whose vectors are digital communication media (Internet, messaging, USB key, CD-ROM, etc.). Its implementation within the company makes it possible to considerably reduce the risk of an infection through an external communication medium and to raise awareness among the company's employees of the risks inherent in the use of these media while educating them in better digital hygiene.

## Typical threat management

Typically company has multiple levels of confidentiality, and the transfer of files between these levels is regulated and requires processing through a secure workstation.

Typically, data coming from outside the company’s network or having been transported outside the offices is considered a potential threat. Data originating from the company’s local network or stored on media that has not left the offices is considered safe. Additional confidentiality levels may exist within the company.

A file coming from the Internet or from a personal USB drive must be checked before being introduced into the company’s IT systems.

## Use cases

The sheep-dip handles the following use cases:
- Scan an external disk connect on USB
- Copy uninfected files on a second external disk
